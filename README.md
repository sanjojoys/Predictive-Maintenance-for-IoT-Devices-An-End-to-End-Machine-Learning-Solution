# Predictive-Maintenance-for-IoT-Devices-An-End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Solution
The project aims to develop a predictive maintenance solution using machine learning for IoT-enabled industrial equipment. It will involve data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and deployment of the solution as a web app or API. The focus is on creating a real-world solution that integrates multiple ML and software engineering components.

Project Features

	1.	Data Source: Simulated IoT sensor data for machinery with features like temperature, vibration, and operational time.
	2.	Preprocessing: Handle missing values, noise, and imbalanced data.
	3.	Feature Engineering: Extract statistical and frequency-based features.
	4.	Machine Learning Models: Compare algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTMs for time-series analysis.
	5.	Model Optimization: Use hyperparameter tuning (e.g., Grid Search, Bayesian Optimization).
	6.	Explainability: Incorporate tools like SHAP or LIME to interpret predictions.
	7.	Deployment: Deploy the model as a Flask or FastAPI application hosted on a cloud platform (AWS, Azure, GCP).
	8.	Integration: Create a front-end interface for user interaction using React or Streamlit.
	9.	CI/CD Pipeline: Use GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.
	10.	Documentation: Provide clear README, installation instructions, and detailed explanations of the pipeline.
