# Predictive-Maintenance-for-IoT-Devices-An-End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Solution
The project aims to develop a predictive maintenance solution using machine learning for IoT-enabled industrial equipment. It will involve data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and deployment of the solution as a web app or API. The focus is on creating a real-world solution that integrates multiple ML and software engineering components.
